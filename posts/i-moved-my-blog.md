Back in 2015 (?, I think...) I moved my blog to Medium, which promised to be a clean and fast blogging platform. It's now 2020 and Medium is everything but that: popups, nag screens and "please subscribe" CTAs everywhere. 

So I moved. 

Originally my plan was to add an articles feature to [lastpage](https://github.com/tomzorz/lastpage), my static site generator but honestly I realized that the project needs a complete refactoring before adding any new features. Because I'm lazy, I decided not to do that... and instead went browsing for a quick solution. I came across the [eleventy (11ty)](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) blog sample, which I liked as it basically did what I intended to build in the first place.

Two nights worth of work adjusting the features and design to my liking, and the new blog was live, hosted on [netlify](https://netlify.com). I moved my still relevant articles over with redirects - but you can still find all the old ones in the [medium publication](https://medium.com/shore-party). Let's hope I'll get at least 5 years of mileage out of this blog instance as well.
